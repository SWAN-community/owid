# Open Web Id (OWID)

Identifies the organisation that captured or generated any type of data with a
primary goal of enabling audit of data used on the web.

Receivers of data with an associated OWID will know when, who, and under what
legal terms and conditions the data was captured or generated.

A data structure, including a cryptographic signature, is added to the data to
support verification.

Key features include.

-   Provides the terms and conditions used to capture or generate data. Data
    receivers can understand what they can and can not do with the data.
-   Cryptographically verifiable.
-   Supports complete supply chain transparency.
-   Random audit of supply chain participants.
-   Supports data compliance within large organisations.
-   Identifies bad actors.
-   Low storage overhead - 73 bytes for any data item when stored in binary
    form.
